# PIG - a dice game

Pig is a dice game that involves two players.

Each player will roll the dice and the number rolled will be added to their score. Unless you roll a one! If a one is rolled, your score is reset and the other player will begin their turn. If you are happy with your score, you can "Hold" your score, and give the other player a turn. First person to reach 100 wins.
